# JavaScript Self-Learning Repository

This repository is my personal project to learn and practice JavaScript step-by-step.

### Whatâ€™s inside?
- Notes and explanations of JavaScript concepts
- Hands-on examples and code snippets
- Small projects to apply what Iâ€™ve learned
- Comparison of similar methods (`append()` vs `appendChild()`, etc.)

This repo helps me track my progress and deepen my understanding of JavaScript.  
Feel free to check it out or use it as a learning resource!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
